<p>We are facing a new problem of increasing apathy for other's.People are hesitant to help someone who is in trouble or even ask for basic rights they have.People don't complaint about lack of sanitation,roads condition ,some more serious issues like farmers condition,bribery etc.And they are in some sense correct ,as no one in todays busy life has time for all this things which directly or indirectly are comming in their way of happy life.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>One of the Solution</h3>

<p>I bet more and more people would have concern about their and everyones rights if the complaint procedure is made less hectic </p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Rejigthesystem works</h3>

<p>It will use twitter as a medium for complaints.You as an end user need to tweet about your complaint along with the hastag #rejigthesystem.Our bot would get your complaint and make it sure it reaches to the person who can solve your problem using machine learning(currently accuracy is around 85%).Our bot would tweet your complaint to the desired person on behalf of you </p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>But do we really need something like rejigthesystem?</h3>

<p>Yes ,we need to have a transparent complaint system in which everyone can know what problems others are facing ,maybe they could have the same problem and support the complaint by retweeting</p>
