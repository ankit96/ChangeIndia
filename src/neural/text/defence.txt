Why is India not ahead of Pakistan in building fighter planes, while India is way ahead in space technology, etc.?
Pakistan is supported by America and China both. America provide him money and China provide him weapons. But India have a friend whose name is Russia, India can built world class sukhoi series plane with Russia.
The Sukhoi/HAL Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) or Perspective Multi-role Fighter (PMF) is a fifth-generation fighter being developed by India and Russia It is a derivative project from the PAK FA (T-50 is the prototype) being developed for the Russian AIr Force FGFA was the earlier designation for the Indian version, while the combined project is now called the Perspective Multi-Role Fighter (PMF).

The completed FGFA will include a total of 43 improvements over the T-50, including stealth, supercruise advanced sensors, networking and combat avionics.

Two separate prototypes will be developed, one by Russia and a separate one by India. The Indian version will be a two-seater for pilot and co-pilot/Weapon system operators.
Does working for an Indian government agency like ISRO and DRDO make you ineligible for a visa to visit different countries?
I would like to work in one of India's central government Labs under the CSIR such as NAL or at DRDO or ISRO. But I have a deep passion for travelling the world. Would my job stop other countries from giving me a VISA?

Today is January 15th, the Indian Army day. Indomitable courage, outstanding leadership and devotion to duty, that’s how you identify the men in olive green.

Far from their homes and loved ones, in the cold winds of frosty Siachen or the heat waves of hot Rajasthan or the hilly terrain of Arunachal, are soldiers on guard to protect our Republic while you are in your cozy home.

Here are some of the stories about the Indian Army that will make you make you realise how much we take our freedom for granted.
 The story of how the brave Indian army defeated China in 1967 and defended Sikkim.
 
 In 1967, at Nathu-La Pass, Sikkim, erstwhile protectorate of India, the Chinese installed loudspeakers and threatened to repeat “1962” if Indians didn’t retreat from the area. The Indian side, heeding no notice, started fencing the pass. The Chinese asked them to stop. Ignoring, our troops continued. Minutes later, murderous medium-machine-gun (MMG) fire started from the other side. The pass – completely devoid of cover – exposed the jawans of the 70 Field Company and the 18 Rajput to the open fire causing heavy fatalities at our side.

Two brave officers – Capt. Dagar of 2 Grenadiers and Major Harbhajan Singh of 18 Rajput reassembled a few troops and tried to assault the Chinese MMG but both died a gallant death. Within 10 minutes, 70 dead Indian soldiers and many other wounded were laying in the open on the pass.

Retaliating, the Indian army asked for the artillery fire and created havoc in the Chinese camp, estimating 400 casualties.

Then, the two sides seemed unstoppable, with China getting a lesson each day. Three days later, the Chinese agreed to ceasefire. 15 days later on October 1, similar incident happened at Cho-La, a few kilometres north of Nathu-La. Despite initial casualties, the 7/11 GR and the 10 JAK RIF stood firm and forced the Chinese to withdraw nearly three kilometres away to Kam-Barracks where they are installed till date. And this is how the Chinese retreated from Sikkim.
No wonder, Sino-Indian border has remained peaceful ever since to the level that today Chinese soldiers come and ask their Indian counterparts at Nathu La for cigarettes, rum and tea; mail is exchanged twice in a week in a hut constructed specially for this purpose and border personnel meeting takes place twice a year.

When this 2nd Lieutenant single-handedly destroyed numerous Pakistani tanks and troops, denying Pakistan to enter Indian soil.

During the 1971 Indo-Pak war, 2nd Lt. Arun Khetarpal’s 17 Poona Horse was ordered to construct a bridge across Basantar river, in the Shakargarh region near the international border with the 47th Indian Infantry Brigade. After building it, engineers were to crack the enemy mine-field. Half-way through, the enemy raided. Even though the mine fields were partly cleared, the regiment advanced, not having considered what laid ahead. By the first light of December 16th, 1971, the army established a link-up at the bridge for the tanks to pass. At 8am, a Pakistani regiment, sufficiently armoured, confronted the Indian troops. Our troops being outnumbered, the Commander of the squadron requested assistance from 2nd Lt. Khetarpal, who was close to the battle-field.

As soon as the request was relayed, Kheterpal got into enemy’s neck to clean it all! On the way, he overran some strong points and captured many soldiers. During this, his group’s second tank was attacked and the commander was killed, leaving him alone fighting the Pakistanis.

But Kheterpal single-handedly went on to ambush the area with his tank. The tank battle followed and 2nd Lt. Khetarpal destroyed four tanks. The Pakistanis then wrecked the other two following tanks and also bombed his tank, flaming it up. Khetarpal, not giving it up, went on to destroy rest of the tanks; after which his own tank blew up. The fearless officer met his death refuting the enemy to step on his land.

When his tank was flamed up, the commander of his troop had ordered him to abandon the burning tank, but he proclaimed:

The parade ground at the National 
Defence Academy is today named the Khetarpal Ground, and the auditorium and one of the main gates bear his name at the Indian Military Academy.

 

#3. How Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey inspired a crucial reclamation that led to India’s victory during the Kargil War.

“Why do you want to join the Army?” “I want to win the Param Vir Chakra.” That’s what was asked to Capt. Manoj Kumar Pandey in his SSB interview. And he remained true to his word! Part of the 1/11 Gorkha Rifles, on June 11th, 1999 during the Kargil War, he led his men to capture the Jubar top, besides a narrow, treacherous ridge towards the backstabbing enemy, now in bunkers on the Indian land.

Pakistanis fired on Capt. Pandey’s men; demonstrating great daring, he gushed ahead of his troop and hailed the enemy with bullets and a loud battle cry. Wounded by bullets on leg and shoulder, he killed two men in the first bunker in hand combat and urged his men to clear all bunkers and collapsed in the final bunker.

On July 3rd, as a part of Operation Vijay, advancing to Khalubar, he was asked to clear off the enemy positions amidst heavy shooting. Audaciously striking the first enemy position, he killed two enemies and destroyed the second position by killing two more. While clearing third, bullets thrashed his shoulder and legs. Undaunted, he continued to lead the assault on the fourth which he destroyed with a grenade and then, a shot penetrated his forehead. ‘Na chhodnu,’ ‘Don’t spare them,’ were his last words. This daredevil act and motivation led to capture of Khalubar.

#4. How General Cariappa became the Indian Army’s first General and what he did when his son was taken as prisoner by Pakistan 18 years later.

(Though it cannot be authenticated, this event is believed to have occurred by many.)

Soon after the independence, Prime Minister Nehru called up a meeting of Defence Minister and senior army officers to appoint the first COAS of Indian Army. Nehru proposed, “I think we should appoint a British officer as a General of the Indian Army, as we don’t have enough experience to lead an army.”

A senior officer, Nathu Singh Rathore snapped, “You see, sir, we don’t have enough experience to lead a nation too, so shouldn’t we appoint a Britisher as the first Prime Minister of India?”

Silence followed and the defence minister of India, Sardar Baldev Singh, offered him to take up the post. He declined, saying, “My senior Lt. Gen. KM Cariappa is better for the job.” and thus Lt. General Kodandera Madappa Cariappa became the first Chief of Army Staff on January 15th, 1948 – and hence this date is also marked as the Indian Army day.

During the 1965 war, his son K C Cariappa, an Indian Air Force pilot, was shot down over Pakistan Major Zaidia and taken as a prisoner of war. On realising the identity of the wounded soldier at Dargil, Pakistan’s Gen. Ayub Khan – who was junior to KM Cariappa before independence, contacted Field Marshal Cariappa, with information about his son’s safety. When Gen. Khan offered to release his son immediately, Field Marshal is reported to have scoffed at the idea and told him to give his son no better treatment than any other Prisoner of War (POW). “He is my son no longer,” the old Soldier is reported to have thundered. “He is the child of this country, a soldier fighting for his motherland like a true patriot. My many thanks for your kind gesture, but I request you to release all or release none. Give him no special treatment.”

 

#5. The soldier who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra “posthumously” but he managed to receive it himself! 

Subedar Yogendra Yadav, being awarded the PVC by the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Armed Forces, the President of India KR Narayanan
Subedar Yogendra Yadav, being awarded the PVC by the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Armed Forces, the President of India KR Narayanan

It’s way past midnight! Sunlight is a few hours away, in the distance you could hear gunfire, in front of you is a snow clad vertical path of 16,500 feet and on the top of it are bunkers in which reside men who are here to take your motherland! This was what was happening on the morning of July 4th, 1999 to Subedar Yogendra Singh and his ‘Ghatak’ Platoon that was asked to capture the Tiger Hill.

Now someone was to climb the cliff and fix ropes so that the feature could be attacked. Subedar Singh of 18 Grenadiers stepped up. Half-way up, an enemy-bunker started firing rockets and machine guns mercilessly, killing the platoon commander and two other colleagues of Subedar. The fire continued and Singh was hit in his crotch and shoulder by multiple bullets, but he continued nonetheless.

When the wounded Subedar Singh reached the top, the first bunker opened fire at him. He ran towards them and hurled a grenade through the window killing the enemy soldiers in the bunker. Then firing away he went to the second bunker, men in which were firing him and his comrades. He along with his other Grenadiers killed four Pakistanis using his bare hands. His partners captured the third bunker and hence the Tiger Hill – a top-priority reclamation for the country.

After a broken leg, a shattered arm and almost 15 bullet wounds, Sudebar Singh was taken to the hospital where it was assumed that he may become a martyr. Param Vir Chakra was announced for his invincible spirit, determination and action beyond the call of the duty, posthumously, but it was found that he was recovering in the hospital and this 19-year-old was awarded the P.V.C. by the then President K. R. Narayanan.

 

#6. The story of Gurkha Regiment:

BeFunky_Yudh_Abhyas_2013_2nd_Batallion_5th_Gurkha_Rifles

Famous for their ever-present kukris – a distinctive heavy knife with a curved blade – and their fierce nature of fighting, the Gurkha regiment is the reason the British failed to annex Nepal to their Empire during the Gurkha war. The British-Indian Army officers were impressed by the tenacity and gallantry of the Gurkha soldiers and encouraged them to volunteer for the East India Company. They did and the Gurkhas remained loyal to British throughout the Raj.

After the partition, the respect for the Gurkhas hadn’t died down from the Britishers’ end and out of the ten Gurkha regiments, the British decided to retain four Gurkha Rifles; the remaining six went on to join the Indian Army.

The 8 Gurkha Rifles regiment has the unique distinction of producing one of the two Field Marshals of the Indian Army: Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, who is still revered as one of Indian Army’s finest officers. Manekshaw once said: “If a man says he’s not afraid of dying, he’s either lying or he’s a Gorkha.”

 

#7. When 120 men and a jeep mounted with a gun defended India against 2000 Pakistanis and 45 tanks.

sleep_well

120 km from Ramgarh, in Thar Desert lies Longewala, an Indian border post. At the post, 120 Indian soldiers were stationed with a Jeep mounted with M40 recoilless rifle. On December 4th, 1971, Lt. Daramveer Bhan who was patrolling the international border reported Pakistani advancement with a large number of armoured vehicles. The company commander Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri got in touch with the battalion HQ requesting reinforcement, armour and weaponry support as they only had medium machine guns. Battalion HQ asked him to either hold back Pakistanis as supply couldn’t reach quickly; or retreat back to Ramgarh. The company, with indomitable Army spirit, chose to stay despite fearing being severely outnumbered by the enemy forces. Around 30 minutes past midnight, 45 tanks and 2000 men of Pakistan took on 120 Indians.

The battle continued all night with Indians successfully guarding their homeland against a massive, massive force. By the time the battle ended on December 7th, a small number of 120 soldiers with the help of 5 airplanes, which were unable to navigate during the night, destroyed 500 Pakistani vehicles (!), killed 200 soldiers and the Pakistanis either lost or abandoned over 34 tanks – one of the highest ever tank losses after WWII.

Only two Indians lost their lives.

Radio intercept by Indian Air Force sent from a Pakistani tank to their HQ, after Indian military shattered advancing Pakistani forces was:

“IAF is giving us extreme trouble, one aircraft goes and another aircraft arrives and dominates the air for about 30 minutes, 40% forces and equipment is already destroyed, even retreating is impossible, let alone retaliating. Immediately send air support, otherwise returning back will be impossible.”

 

#8. “I’ll either come back after raising the Indian flag in victory or return wrapped in it.”

Capt. Vikram Batra, PVC
Capt. Vikram Batra, PVC

On June 1st, 1999, when the Kargil war was to erupt, one Capt Vikram Batra’s unit was sent to Kargil daring operation to recapture the Point 5140 – of utmost importance to India. Point 5140 was at a height of 17,000 feet.

Reaching Point 5140, Capt Batra faced the commander of the Pakistani-backed terrorists on radio. The enemy commander provoked him, “Why have you come here Shershah, you will not go back.” Captain Batra, being the last person to back away from a fight, replied, “We shall see within one hour who remains on the top.” In a short while Captain Batra and his company of troops killed eight enemy soldiers and captured a heavy anti-aircraft machine gun, neutralising the advantageous peak. Mission Point 5140 was a success. Soon after he radioed his Commanding Officer (CO), “Yeh dil mange more!”

Next chapter was Point 4750, where he was dared again by the enemy who said, “Shershah, nobody shall be left to lift your dead bodies!” Shershah, as nicknamed by his CO hurled, “Don’t worry about us, pray for your safety.” Later he re-captured Point 4750 and hoisted the national flag.

His heart, in zeal of patriotism wanting victory, made him volunteer for his third task of re-capturing point 4875. On July 5th, 1999, after thrashing intruders, his company and others lead by Capt. Anuj Nayyar, re-captured the peak. The enemy counter-attacked on July 7th but the team retaliated with enthusiasm. During the fire-exchange, Capt Batra’s junior Lt. Naveen was hit and Shershah jumped to his rescue, who was pleading to let him continue to which he replied, “Tu baal bachedaar hai! Hatt jaa peeche.” (You are the one with kids; back away!) And while saving his comrade, a bullet found its way to Capt Batra’s heart and the brave captain with the words, “Jai Mata Di” fell on the ground to become immortal in our hearts.

#9. When Prime Minister of India asked the General of the Indian Army, “Are you trying to grab the power?”

Sam_Manekshaw

“Sam, what are you doing?”
“Sitting in my office and having tea, Madam.”
“Come to my office, I’ll give you tea here.”

This is what PM Indira Gandhi told Chief of Army Staff Gen. Sam Manekshaw one fine morning during the days that Indira Gandhi was not-so-popular amongst her party and opposition for being a one-woman ruler!

“Everybody says you are taking over. When are you taking over?” Gandhi asked.
“What do you think?”
“I don’t think you would.”
“You’re right Madam Prime Minister. My daughter, when she comes from the convent sings the nursery rhyme, ‘you mind your business, I mind mine; you kiss your own sweetheart, I kiss mine’. You have a long nose. So have I. But I don’t poke my nose into other people’s affairs. I do not interfere with politics and politicians.” Sam Maneskshaw even offered to quit on grounds of mental instability.

This wasn’t the first time the Prime Minister had the taste of Sam Maneskshaw. One day in April 1971, when India was becoming the home to millions of refugees from the East Pakistan, Indira Gandhi wanted to attack East Pakistan and get rid of the problem of West Pakistan’s bias to East. She called up the cabinet along with Sam Bahadur and told them about her plan. Sam declared that if we attack now, India would lose the battle as the Army was not ready.

Soon after the Cabinet members retired from the meeting, Sam offered his resignation; “There is a very thin line between being dismissed and becoming a field-marshal,” as he recalls but again Gandhi refused and asked him to prepare.

And so he did.

As war drew closed, Indira Gandhi asked her army chief if he was ready for the fight. Gen. Manekshaw replied with the chivalry, flirtatiousness and utter boldness for which he was famous: “I am always ready, sweetie.”

And ready he was; winning Dhaka in two weeks.

Gen. Manekshaw truly became immortal in the history of India for his brave acts and the way he stood up to his political bosses for his soldiers as he once said, “I wonder whether those of our political masters who have been put in charge of the defence of the country can distinguish a mortar from a motor; a gun from a howitzer; a guerrilla from a gorilla, although a great many resemble the latter.”

 

So, the men in olive green, that is how we define a hero. We at Youth Connect salute the Indian Army for the selfless and brave job they do every day and every night of protecting our freedom, our Republic. Thank you.

Far from home and loved ones, these heroes sacrifice their own lives so the entire nation can sleep in peace. The stories of their courage and passion are larger than life. Read on and be inspired by 10 such army heroes – they are legends whose tales will not just make your chests swell with pride, but whose sacrifices will leave your eyes a little moist.

They are men of steel, standing tall in the harshest of conditions. They disregard freezing cold temperatures and scorching heat to always remain brave, awake and devoted towards us.

They are all heroes, each and every one of them. But there are a few whose stories have become the stuff of legends, stories that deserve to be shared and told over and over again:

Born in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, Captain Vikram Batra of 13 J&K Rifles, is known as the hero of the Kargil war. He led one of the toughest war operations in Kashmir, and was also called Sher Shah (in the intercepted messages of the Pakistani army).

He was instrumental in recapturing Peak 5140, which is located at an altitude of 17,000 feet. During this mission, Batra was seriously injured but still managed to kill three enemy soldiers in close combat. After capturing Peak 5140, he went on yet another difficult mission to recapture Peak 4875 on July 7, 1999. Batra made a call to his father before he left and told him about the crucial mission. Hardly did he know that this would be his last call home.

It was one of the most difficult missions the Indian army attempted because the Pakistani forces were sitting above the peak at 16,000 feet and the climb gradient was 80 degrees. On their way up, one of Batra’s fellow officers was severely injured. Batra set out to save him. When a subedar tried to help him save the officer, Batra pushed him aside, saying, “You have children, step aside.” He saved his fellow soldier but was killed while clearing enemy positions. Batra’s last words were “Jai Mata Di.”

A famous quote by Batra is: “Either I will come back after hoisting the tricolour (Indian flag), or I will come back wrapped in it, but I will be back for sure.” He was honoured with the Param Vir Chakra.

Quick fact: The 2003 Hindi film LOC Kargil had a character based on Captain Batra, played by Abhishek Bachchan.

2. Major General Ian Cardozo

Major General Ian Cardozo, who has many achievements to his name, will always be known for his immense courage in the 1971 war with Pakistan. He was, at the time, a young major with 5 Gorkha Rifles. During the war, he stepped on a landmine and severely injured his leg. When even the doctor could not cut his leg, Cardozo asked for a khukri (the Gorkha knife) and cut his own leg off, saying, “Now go and bury it!”

The incident did not deter Cardozo from going on to serve his country. Through sheer willpower and determination, he continued to perform his duties as a soldier and became the first disabled officer in the Indian Army to command an infantry battalion and a brigade. In spite of not being physically at par with other officers, he defeated many ‘two-legged’ soldiers to come first in many fitness tests during his stint in the army.

3. Brigadier Mohammad Usman
Born in Bibipur, Uttar Pradesh, this man of steel joined the Indian army in 1934. During the Indo-Pakistan war of 1947/48, Brigadier Usman repulsed a fierce attack on Naushera and Jhangar, two highly strategic locations in Jammu and Kashmir, and was named by his fellow soldiers ‘The Lion of Naushera.’

At the time of the Partition, he was made the offer of becoming the Chief of the Pakistani Army but he chose to stay in India. He left the Baloch regiment of Pakistan and was inducted into the Dogra regiment in India. After the Battle of Naushera, where the Pakistanis suffered heavy casualties at his hands, the same country that had courted him to become the chief of the army, now went ahead and placed prize money of Rs. 50,000 on his head.

Brigadier Usman was not just a fierce soldier but also a compassionate man. He never got married and used to donate a large part of his salary to support poor children and pay for their education. This inspiring and exemplary officer of the Indian Army died on July 3, 1948, defending Jhangar. His last words were, “I am dying but let not the territory we were fighting for fall to the enemy.”

He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously for his great courage and leadership.

4. Subedar Yogendra Singh Yadav
This brave soldier has the high honour of being the youngest recipient of the Param Vir Chakra. He received this award at the age of 19 for his actions on July 4,1999, during the Kargil war. Born in 1980 in Aurangabad Ahir village, Uttar Pradesh, Yadav showed immense courage during the war in 1999. He volunteered for the task of capturing three strategic bunkers on Tiger Hill, which were situated at the top of a vertical, snow-covered, 16,500 feet high cliff face.

He was climbing the high cliff with the help of a rope when the enemy bunker started rocket fire. Yadav was hit by three bullets in his groin and shoulder. Despite being severely injured, Yadav kept climbing and finished the remaining 60 feet to reach the top of the cliff. Though in immense pain, Yadav crawled to the first enemy bunker and lobbed a grenade, which killed four Pakistani soldiers and set back the enemy fire. This gave the rest of the Indian platoon the opportunity to climb up the cliff face.

However, this was not it. Yadav continued to fight and destroyed the second bunker too with the help of two fellow soldiers. In fact, he also engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy and killed four more Pakistani soldiers. By the time the rest of the Indian platoon arrived, Yadav had already neutralised the enemy attack. This gave Indian soldiers the upper hand and they managed to accomplish one of the toughest missions of the Kargil war – the capture of Tiger Hill.

During the second part of the fight, a few more bullets hit Yadav. Some say he was hit by 16 bullets, some say less, but he survived it all. Yadav’s heroic actions were portrayed in the film, Lakshya, by actor Hrithik Roshan.

5. Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat

Words fall short when it comes to telling this brave man’s story. A hero of the 1962 Indo-China war, Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat of the 4th Garhwal Rifles Infantry Regiment is the only soldier in the history of the Indian Army who has risen through the ranks after his death. He was ‘promoted’ to the rank of Major General 40 years after his death, and is still believed to ‘command’ troops guarding India’s eastern frontiers with China.

During the 1962 war, soldiers were ordered to vacate their posts as soon as possible due to heavy casualties against the Chinese at the Battle of Nuranang. But Jaswant did not leave his position and continued to fight even after the other soldiers had left.

Rawat was helped by two Monpa tribal girls named Sela and Nura. The trio set up weapons at separate points and maintained a volume of fire to make the Chinese believe they were facing a huge battalion. Rawat successfully managed to fool them for three days. But the Chinese found out about the set up through a man who used to supply rations to Rawat and the two girls. At this point, Rawat chose to shoot himself rather than be captured by the Chinese forces. The Chinese were so furious on learning that they had been fighting a single soldier all this time that they cut off Rawat’s head and carried it back to China.

The post that Rawat held to repulse the Chinese troops has been renamed Jaswant Garh in recognition of his courage. A small shrine to Rawat has also come up at the battle spot. All army personnel who pass by this route make sure to pay their respects to him here.

Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously.

6. Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal
Born in Pune, 2nd Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal of the 17 Poona Horse regiment is yet another braveheart who died too young at the age of 21. He died in the Battle of Basantar during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, where his brave actions earned him the Param Vir Chakra posthumously.

Khetarpal showed immense courage and strong will when Pakistani armour, which was superior in strength, counterattacked at Jarpal, in the Shakargarh sector, in December, 1971. Though Khetarpal was in a different squadron, he rushed to help, moving towards the enemy, overrunning the defences with his tanks, and capturing Pakistani infantry and weapons.

When the commander of his troops was killed, Khetarpal continued to attack the enemy fiercely until the latter’s tanks started pulling back. Khetarpal even managed to destroy one of the withdrawing tanks.

But the enemy reformed their armour and prepared for a second attack. This time they targeted the sector held by Khetarpal. The attack was severe and swift. Khetarpal was wounded but managed to hit 10 enemy tanks. He was asked to abandon his tank but realised that if he left it the enemy would break through. He fought courageously and destroyed another enemy tank. But then his own tank received another hit, which resulted in the death of this courageous officer.

7. Major Somnath Sharma
This brave soldier of Fourth Kumaon regiment sacrificed his life at the young age of 24. With his hand already in plaster from an injury sustained in a hockey game, Sharma insisted on being with his company in combat when they were airlifted to Srinagar on October 30, 1947 to fight Pakistani invaders.

On November 3, when Sharma’s company was on a patrol of Badgam village, it was approached by a tribal lashkar of 700 raiders from the direction of Gulmarg. The company was soon surrounded from three sides and endured heavy casualties from the ensuing heavy mortar bombardment. Realising that Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if they abandoned the battle at this point, Sharma ran from post to post, encouraging his men to fight in the face of an enemy that outnumbered them seven to one.

When heavy casualties adversely affected their firing power, Sharma, with his left hand in plaster, took to filling the magazines for the men operating light machine guns. While he was busy fighting, a mortar shell exploded on the ammunition near him, killing him instantly.

His last message to Brigade HQ, received a few moments before he was killed, was: “The enemy is only 50 yards from us. We are heavily outnumbered. We are under devastating fire. I shall not withdraw an inch but will fight to our last man and our last round.”

Major Somnath Sharma was the first recipient of the Param Vir Chakra. The citation on the award says, “His leadership, gallantry and tenacious defence were such that his men were inspired to fight the enemy by seven to one, six hours after this gallant officer had been killed.”

8. Naik Jadu Nath Singh
Naik Jadu Nath Singh, the fourth recipient of the Param Vir Chakra, fought in Jammu and Kashmir in the Indo-Pak war of 1947/48. His presence of mind and bravery saved his post, not just once but thrice, from the enemy. On the crucial day of February 6, 1948, Singh was in command of a forward post at Taindhar. Nine men garrisoned the post.

The Pakistanis launched their attack in successive waves to take this post. At this juncture, Singh showed superb leadership and used his small force in such a manner that the enemy retreated in utter confusion. With four wounded men, he re-organised his force to face another onslaught. He did not give in despite being outnumbered.

When all his men, himself included, were wounded, he took over the Bren gun from the wounded gunner and continued to fight. The enemy were now on the walls of the post but Singh’s fire was so devastating that the post was saved for a second time.

Every one in his post was dead by now. The Pakistanis came in again for a third attack. Wounded and alone, Sharma charged out of his post with his sten gun firing, surprising the enemy and forcing it to flee back in confusion again. But two bullets caught Sharma in the head and chest and this gallant soldier died instantly.

9. Subedar Karam Singh
Born in Sehna village in the Sangrur District of Punjab, Karam Singh was the first non-posthumous Param Vir Chakra awardee. Singh retired from the Indian Army as Honorary Captain in 1948 and died in 1993 at the age of 77. He is also the only Indian to win the highest medals of both the British and Indian governments.

Among his several brave acts, Karam Singh is best known for his courage on 13 October, 1948, when Pakistan decided to launch a brigade attack to retake Richhmar Gali in Kashmir. The firing was so furious that it destroyed almost all the bunkers in the Indian platoon. The communication with the commander was also cut off and Singh could not update his situation or ask for reinforcements.

He was left with just one choice – to fight the enemy with whatever little army and weapons he had. The attacks had left Karam Singh severely injured but nothing could deter his spirit. He refused to evacuate the post even when the enemy got very close. When enemy soldiers came even closer, Karam Singh jumped out of his trench and stabbed two intruders to death. His brave act demoralised the enemy so much that they broke off the attack.

10. Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran
Born in Mumbai, Maharashtra, Parameswaran is yet another braveheart who died at the age of 41 in 1987, in India’s Sri Lanka operations. He was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, posthumously.

It was late night when Parameswaran was returning from search operations in Sri Lanka, when his column was suddenly attacked by a group of militants. He did not panic and showed great presence of mind by encircling the enemy from the rear and surprising them with an unexpected attack. During the hand-to-hand combat, a militant shot him in the chest. Undaunted, Major Parameswaran snatched the rifle from the militant and shot him dead.

Barely able to stand now, he continued giving orders to his men and inspired them to fight till his last breath. The Indians managed to kill five militants and recovered three rifles and two rocket launchers from the militants.


Advanced Technology Vehicle – that’s the name of the ‘rocket’ that ISRO will be testing mid-July, in the second in the series of experiments the organisation is conducting en route to developing India’s first reusable launch vehicle (RLV).

On May 23, ISRO tested a scaled-down prototype of the RLV, dubbed RLV-TD for ‘technology demonstrator’. It comprised an airplane-shaped upper stage fixed to a solid rocket booster and hoicked to 70 km. There, the booster fell off and the RLV-TD was manoeuvred by an onboard computer to glide down into the Indian Ocean, where it disintegrated. (Note: the technical details of this mission were published by ISRO a few days ago.)

A six-times-larger version of the RLV-TD is eventually expected to be built by ISRO by 2030. Once ready, it will be able to launch satellites into the low-Earth orbit and sail back down to land, like a conventional airplane, on a custom runway. With it, ISRO hopes to be able to reduce launch costs by 10-times as well as reduce payload cost from the prevailing $5,000/kg to $2,000/kg. The global average is much higher.

The RLV’s economy is enhanced it if it is able to lift heavier payloads. One way to achieve this is by reducing the amount of oxidisers that the vehicle will carry. The PSLV rocket carries 225 tonnes of propellants when it launches, and each mission can lift 3,250 kg to the low-Earth orbit at a cost of Rs 90 crore. About 70% of the propellants are oxidisers: compounds that allow the combustion of the fuel itself. However, ISRO plans to use a kind of engine onboard the RLV that will be able to suck in oxygen from the atmosphere, so the vehicle won’t have to carry an oxidiser for that engine.

The Advanced Technology Vehicle (ATV) to be tested mid-July will test precisely this component. And for this, ISRO engineers have designed an indigenous scramjet engine.

In a regular engine, a fuel-oxygen combination is pumped into a combustion chamber, where a spark plug (or equivalent) ignites the mixture to release energy. In a vehicle powered by a scramjet engine, the vehicle carries only the fuel. Once it has been launched using a conventional engine and goes supersonic, the scramjet engine will inhale oxygen from the atmosphere to ignite the fuel. In effect, it’s a modified ramjet engine but with the ability to function at supersonic velocities.

ISRO plans to affix an ATV bearing a scramjet engine on a two-stage sounding rocket during the mid-July test. The first stage of the rocket will – like in the first test – take the ATV to a height of about 70 km and fall off. Then, the ATV will coast for a bit before starting to plummet. During the coasting phase, the ATV will be travelling at Mach 6 (2 km/s). That’s when ISRO plans to test the scramjet engine for five seconds.

Sounding rockets are typically one- or two-stage projectiles that are used to probe the upper atmosphere. According to ISRO, the ATV will be the second stage of an RH-560 sounding rocket. ‘RH’ stands for the Rohini class of sounding rockets and 560 is its diameter in millimetres.

The RH-560 was previously tested in March 2010, when it was qualified as being India’s heaviest sounding rocket at three tonnes. During that test, designated ATV-D01, the rocket successfully maintained a velocity of Mach 6 for seven seconds as well as attained a dynamic pressure of around 80 kilopascals. A statement released apropos ATV-D01 had said, “It carried a passive scramjet engine combustor module as a test bed for demonstration of air-breathing propulsion technology. … These conditions are required for a stable ignition of active scramjet engine combustor module planned in the next flight of ATV.”

Though the ATV test slated for mid-July is the second in a series that will lead up to the building of the RLV, it is not one of the four ‘broader’ experiments some of whose details ISRO had already announced. The first, called HEX 1, was conducted on May 23. Its purpose was to test the guiding computer onboard the RLV-TD and the performance of heat-resistant tiles affixed to the vehicle. In the second test, called a landing experiment (LEX), ISRO will attempt to land an RLV-TD on a custom runway parked in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

In the third test, an RLV-TD will be launched by a sounding rocket and made to land on the runway in a single mission. In the fourth, the vehicle will be actively powered by a scramjet engine. The dates for the last three tests haven’t been announced.

Apart from using a scramjet engine, ISRO has said that the RLV will also be fit with five semi-cryogenic engines. Its payload capacity to the low-Earth orbit is expected to be in the range of 10,000-20,000 kg. To compare, India’s heaviest extant rocket, the GSLV Mk-III, uses one cryogenic engine to be able to lift 8,000 kg to the same orbit. These specifications may pall in comparison to those offered by other spaceflight players, especially SpaceX, by the time the RLV is ready in 2030. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket can already lift 13,000 kg to the low-Earth orbit for about $57 million (Rs 382 crore).

However, ISRO chief A.S. Kiran had told Frontline in an interview in May this year, “In principle, even if the cost comes down by 50 per cent, it is worth it. After factoring in the logistics of recovering it, etc., whatever it can bring down is worth it


Commentators and columnists usually love to take potshots at public sector undertakings. Much of the discussion around PSU disinvestment revolves around how quickly and cleverly the Government can get rid of these capital-guzzling white elephants.

But a majority aren’t really in dire straits. In 2014-15, a forgettable year for the economy and India Inc, 157 of the 235 central PSUs made profits, outnumbering loss-makers (77) by a factor of two. Their aggregate profit of ₹1.30 lakh crore easily overhauled the ₹27,000 crore losses notched up by the red brigade.

However, the problem with thriving state-owned firms is that they like to hide their light under a bushel. This is why we combed through the latest Public Enterprises Survey and the websites of central ministries, to unearth five promising PSUs that Indian investors may love to own. They aren’t listed yet, but we hope they will be.


HAL ::

The Tejas light combat aircraft’s recent debut in the Indian Air Force represents a big breakthrough for Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which, allying with the Aeronautical Development Agency, has developed Tejas from scratch over two decades. HAL has over 20 units and 10 R&amp;D centres across India, and it designs, manufactures and overhauls aircrafts for Indian defence. Expectations are that Tejas will emerge as the mainstay for the IAF’s long-overdue fleet modernisation plans. The Government’s Make in India drive with a thrust on the defence sector, promises burgeoning order flows for HAL. 

The opening up of Indian defence to 100 per cent FDI may also help HAL forge foreign partnerships to tap new opportunities. HAL has recorded consistent, if slow-growing financials. Its total revenues grew from Rs 14,204 crore to Rs. 16,524 crore in the five years to FY16 while net profits rose from Rs. 2,114 crore to Rs. 3,210 crore. It earns gross margins of 20-24% with return on equity of 18-20%

The much-hyped multi-billion dollar Rafale deal could see some forward movement tomorrow as the top acquisition body of the Defence Ministry is set to take a review of the negotiations held so far into the purchase of the French fighters.

Defence sources said the Rafale fighter jet deal is one of the issues that will be discussed during the meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council tomorrow at the South Block.

As per the normal process, once the deal is cleared by Defence Ministry, the file will go to the Finance Ministry and then to the Cabinet Committee on Security for final clearance.

In an interview to Press Trust of India in May, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had said he was looking at wrapping up the deal soon and this could mean by end of June or July.

Rejecting suggestions that there has been a delay in signing the contract for nearly 7.89 Billion Euros to procure the French fighter planes, the Minister said any such process takes at least 6-8 months.

The deal was announced by PM Modi in April last year during his visit to France when he said India would purchase 36 Rafales in a government-to-government contract.

Soon after the announcement, the Defence Ministry scrapped a separate process that was on to purchase 126 Rafales, built by French defence giant Dassault Aviation. The current deal comes with the clause of delivering 50 per cent offsets, creating business worth at least 3 billion Euros for smaller Indian companies and generating thousands of new jobs in India through the offsets.

The commercial negotiations, as in the pricing of the planes, equipment and other issues, actually began only in mid-January this year

Ministry of Defence is soon expected place orders for the purchase of 12 S-400 Triumph Anti-Aircraft missile systems to secure Indian skies. This was stated as the official stand of the Make in India program spearheaded by India's PM Narendra Modi at the international industrial exhibition “Innoprom” in Yekaterinburg.

According to information at the booth, India plans to lease two more “Akula-2” class Nuclear Submarine  with the ability to purchase them after the completion of the lease term. 

It is also reported that India has also ordered four Russian long-range Tu-22M3 Nuclear Bombers, 80 Mi-17 helicopters and 6 IL-76 airplanes which are suitable for the Israeli Phalcon radar. 

The submission also states that the ;Make in India initiative on Indian territory is currently manufacturing a total of 1000 state-of-the-art T-90s battle tanks and will soon start production of more than 200 Ka-226 helicopters.

Russia is also modernising India's fleet of Mig-29 fighter jets under a $900 million upgrade contract. 

On the missile front, India is mass producing the supersonic Brahmos Cruise Missile and raising multiple missile regiments to augment its offensive strike capability vis-a-vis China. Talks are also underway to upgrade the entire fleet of India Su-30 MKI's to Super Sukhoi standards thus making them the most formidable fighter jets in the whole of Asia.

THE HAGUE: An international tribunal today ruled against China in a bitter row over territorial claims to the South China Sea that is likely to ratchet up regional tensions. 

&quot;The tribunal concluded that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights within the sea areas falling within the &#39;nine-dash line&#39;,&quot; the Permanent Court of Arbitration said in a statement. 

All eyes were watching for reaction from the Asian political and military powerhouse, which had fired off a barrage of criticism even before the decision by the PCA in THE HAGUE was announced. 

China asserts sovereignty over almost all of the strategically vital waters in the face of rival claims from its Southeast Asian neighbours. 

Manila had lodged the suit against Beijing in 2013, saying that after 17 years of negotiations it had exhausted all political and diplomatic avenues. 

Beijing waged a months-long campaign to discredit the panel, which it says has no jurisdiction in the multinational dispute, and it refused to take part in the case. 

The state-run China Daily topped its front page with a picture of Woody Island in the Paracels, emblazoned: &quot;Arbitration invalid&quot;. 

English-language headlines on the official Xinhua news agency included: &quot;South China Sea arbitration abuses international law: Chinese scholar&quot;, &quot;Permanent Court of Arbitration must avoid being used for political purposes&quot; and &quot;The sea where Chinese fishermen live and die&quot;. 

Ahead of the decision, new Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte had signalled he did not want to antagonise China, saying he would not &quot;taunt or flaunt&quot; a favourable ruling and would seek a &quot;soft landing&quot; with China. 

China&#39;s claims were first enshrined in a map drawn in the 1940s with a nine-dash line stretching south from China and encircling almost all of the sea, although it says Chinese fishermen have been using it for centuries. 

To bolster its position it has rapidly turned reefs into artificial islands capable of hosting military planes. 

It has held naval drills between the Paracels and the southern Chinese island of Hainan in recent days. 

US naval destroyers have been patrolling near the Chinese-claimed Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands, supported by aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, the US-based Navy Times reported. 

Chinese state media have said Beijing will not take a &quot;single step back&quot; after the ruling, and President Xi Jinping said earlier this month that China would never compromise on sovereignty, adding: &quot;We are not afraid of trouble.&quot; 

China had sought diplomatic support around the world, and foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said its latest backers included Angola, Madagascar and Papua New Guinea, showing that &quot;justice and righteousness always have popular support&quot;. 

&quot;Who is upholding the sanctity of international law and who is breaking international law, I think people are all clear about that,&quot; Lu said. 

Manila lodged its suit against Beijing in 2013, saying China was in violation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to which both countries are signatories. 

One of the key issues was whether the land features in the area are islands capable of supporting human habitation -- which under UNCLOS are entitled to territorial waters and an exclusive economic zone -- or rocks, which only have territorial waters, or low-tide elevations, which get neither. 

If none of the outcrops are islands, then none of the claimants to them would gain sole rights to major expanses of the waters around them. 

&quot;The ruling can reduce the scope of the South China Sea disputes, but will not solve them,&quot; said analysts Yanmei Xie and Tim Johnston of the International Crisis Group in a report. 

The ruling was likely to &quot;escalate the war of words&quot;, they said, but added: &quot;Escalation to military standoffs is not inevitable.&quot; 

China could choose to withdraw from UNCLOS, or begin building on Scarborough Shoal, which Washington would view as a provocation. 

Beijing could also declare an air defence identification zone over the South China Sea, claiming the right to interrogate aircraft passing through the airspace, or try to remove a ship grounded by the Philippines on Second Thomas Shoal for use as a base. 

Alternatively, it could move to reduce tensions. 

Philippine Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay told AFP on Friday that Manila hoped to open direct talks with Beijing on the dispute, and presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said Tuesday: &quot;The top priority will be national interest.&quot; 

The Philippine embassy in China has warned its citizens to beware of personal &quot;threats&quot; and avoid political debates. 

Nationalist demonstrations are not rare in China, sometimes apparently with the tacit backing of authorities. 

More than 20 Chinese police were positioned outside the Philippine embassy on Tuesday, with more in vans nearby -- a significantly larger presence than usual -- along with two lorries loaded with crowd control barriers, a possible indication that authorities expected protests at the building. " 

J&K :: Protests or no protests ; Centre orders Army to go full steam against terror Unfazed by violent protests in south Kashmir in the wake of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani &#39;s killing, the security establishment will continue to go full-steam in its fight against terror. The encounter in Handwara and the foiling of an infiltration bid in Keran on Monday exhibit the security establishment&#39;s resolve to deal firmly with those who pick up arms and indulge in violence. 

According to a top officer of the security establishment, protests or no protests, there would be no compromise on crushing terror with armed action. Stating that J&amp;K has witnessed several cycles of violence in the past, including the protests over Amarnath in 2008 and the stone-pelting attacks that killed 150 civilians in 2010, the officer said the violent protests following Wani killing were another phase that would pass. 

Angry mobs will not distract us from our goal to neutralise terrorists who endorse violence and hit our police and security forces. While we will ensure judicious use of force to deal with local civilians, a terrorist who dares to hit the state and indulges in mindless violence will have to face the consequences, including death as the security forces challenge him said an officer. 

Whether Wani  killing would spur a fresh round of local recruitment, the security establishment on Monday said any such fallout will be prevented by pushing a slew of welfare measures aimed at gainfully engaging the J&amp;K youth and boosting local industries like tourism and handicrafts. 

The prime minister announcement of 80,000 crore package for J&K last year was a step in that direction. The welfare schemes and initiatives covered in the package will start rolling out soon, helping to generate employment in the Valley. This will reduce terror recruitment, said a government official. 

According to intelligence agencies, Wani killing may have acted as a trigger for outpouring of locals&#39; angst against the state government, lack of jobs, etc. &quot;The violence was not an isolated reaction to Wani killing, said an intelligence officer. 

A top officer of the security establishment said that signs of return to normalcy were visible on Monday.


India is boosting negotiations with Russia on joint development and creation of the fifth-generation fighter (FGFA - Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft) and is ready for the sides’ equal contribution to the project worth $4 billion at the stage of development work, The Times of India newspaper reported on Monday with reference to the Indian Defense Ministry.

India is finally taking forward the negotiations with Russia on stalled mega projects to jointly develop a futuristic fifth-generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) as well as upgrade its existing Sukhoi-30MKI jets into ‘Super Sukhois’ with advanced avionics and weapons, the article says.

Though India and France are now close to inking the estimated €7.8 billion deal for 36 Rafale jets, the Defense Ministry acknowledges that just 36 fighters will not be enough to stem the country&#39;s hemorrhaging air combat power. The IAF is down to just 33 fighter squadrons - including 11 obsolete MiG-21 and MiG-27 squadrons slated for retirement - when at least 42 are required to keep the &quot;collusive China-Pakistan threat&quot; at bay.

The multi-pronged strategy&quot; to progressively crank up airpower ranges from inducting the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft to exploring a second line of fighter production in the country, with the American FA-18 and F-16 as well as Swedish Gripen-E already in contention for this proposed ‘Make in India’ project, The Times of India writes.

Apart from these 4th-generation fighters, the Defense Ministry is now finally working towards inking the final R&amp;D design contract with Russia this year for the Indian &quot;perspective multi-role fighter&quot;, a variant of the Russian single-seat FGFA called Sukhoi T-50 or PAK-FA. Apart from resolving technical and cost issues, Russia has also agreed to allow IAF test pilots to fly its prototypes now,&quot; said a source. The final R&amp;D contract for the FGFA was on hold till now despite the two countries having first inked an inter-governmental agreement in 2007 and then following it up with a $295 million preliminary design contract in 2010, as was earlier reported by The Times of India. Under the main design contract to be executed in over six years now, India and Russia will chip in around $4 billion each for prototype development, testing and infrastructure build-up. The overall cost for producing 127 of these single-seat fighters - which will combine stealth, super-cruise and multi-sensor integration - in India will be about $25 billion.

Amid all this, the Indian Defense Ministry is also trying to ensure &quot;maximum operationally availability&quot; of the existing fighters at any given time. Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, for instance, says serviceability of Sukhois has jumped to 60% now from an alarming 46% earlier.



Sweden’s Saab AB will join Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. in the search for local partners to help build its fighter jets, as competition increases for a slice of India’s planned $150 billion military modernization.

While certain parts of the Gripen E planes will be built in factories fully owned by Saab, other components will be manufactured jointly, said Jan Widerstrom, chairman of Saab India Technologies Pvt. The Adani Group could be among companies being considered, the Economic Times reported in May, without saying where it got the information.

&quot;We are talking to at least six large companies in India as the main partners, and several hundred for the supply chain,&quot; Widerstrom said in a July 7 interview in New Delhi. &quot;We are still evaluating our partners and most likely we need more than one.&quot;

India is expected to announce a contract for fighter jets next year, with local production in focus as Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks to create jobs and reduce the world’s highest arms imports. Soon after taking office in 2014 he allowed more foreign direct investment in defense and, last month, he further eased rules for the sector.

Under the latest tweaks announced June 20, foreign companies can hold more than 49 percent of a company based in India even if it doesn’t provide state-of-the-art technology. Concerns exist, though, on whether local companies have the trained workforce to deliver.

&quot;There exists an ecosystem, but that ecosystem needs to develop further,” said Pushan Das, a junior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think tank in New Delhi.“Indian companies are yet to acquire the manufacturing wherewithal to manufacture complete military grade aircraft platforms.”

Moreover, the airforce would probably prefer a two-engine craft rather than the single-engine Gripen, he said. Saab had lost out to Dassault Aviation SA for that reason in 2007, when India had last sought bids for fighter jets, before talks stalled on the deal partly because India sought quality guarantees for the Rafales made locally.


Indigenous Weapons

Saab may have it easier. It has a center with Tech Mahindra Ltd. in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, where more than 100 engineers are already working on the design and development of Gripen jets for Brazil. It will also build on its existing partnerships, such as an aerostructure venture with Indian company Aequs, Widerstrom said.

Saab has also offered to help India with its indigenous Tejas jet, as well as the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft program, which seeks to design and build a fifth-generation fighter.

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has said the country needs local production lines for at least two types of fighter aircraft. The government says 60 percent of its defense requirements are currently met by imports.


‘Next 100 Years’

Even as India faces geopolitical threats from neighbors Pakistan and China, a third of its 650-strong combat airfleet is over 40 years old, and the Tejas was 33 years in the making.

India was the world’s largest arms importer, according to a February 2016 report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in part because its companies have failed to produce competitive, indigenous weapons.

Saab would want a 100 percent investment in an Indian project in the coming years, but for now would prefer working with local partners in both the private and public sectors. It will also offer a transfer of technology, Widerstrom said. The company expects to sell about 450 Gripen jets worldwide over the next 20 years.

India is exploring direct diplomatic intervention and government guarantees to rescue a deal for an urgent warship requirement by the Philippines to patrol the South China Sea after a Kolkata-based shipyard that emerged the lowest bidder failed in financial assessment tests by the buyer. 

The defence ministry has requested Indian mission in Manila to help resolve the matter, which has gained more urgency after the Philippines won a Hague ruling against China over the South China Sea dispute, officials told ET. 

They said the Indian diplomatic mission in Manila has been made aware of the problem being faced by state-owned Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) that had made a Rs 2,150-crore bid to supply two light frigates to the Philippines, with a request for intervention. Earlier this month, GRSE bid suffered a setback after it failed to meet financial requirements in post-qualification assessment by the Philippine navy, as reported by ET. 

Unlike the Indian system of procurement, where the navy or coast guard make trance payments as the construction progresses at the yard, the Philippines order was structured around a single payment only when the frigates were delivered. 

The Philippine navy found that while GRSE had physical infrastructure and capability, it did not have adequate funds available to carry out the construction of the vessels over the next few years without any supporting payments. 

Sources have told ET that several options are now being explored to revive the contract, including discussions on whether India could provide guarantees that the yard would be backed up with financial assistance to execute the contract. 

The GRSE bid for the light frigates had earlier beat proposals from Korean shipbuilding giants Daewoo and Hyundai and Spanish firm Navantia to emerge as the winner on both technical and commercial grounds. 

India has been pursuing military supply contracts, particularly in the naval domain, in several nations in the South China Sea region. As reported earlier, the country is also firming up several military contracts with Vietnam — Brahmos missile system, weaponising two of its Petya class frigates for an antisubmarine role and supply of at least ten patrol boats.

NEW DELHI: India is exploring direct diplomatic intervention and government guarantees to rescue a deal for an urgent warship requirement by the Philippines to patrol the South China Sea after a Kolkata-based shipyard that emerged the lowest bidder failed in financial assessment tests by the buyer.

Strongly hitting back at Pakistan for raising in the UN the issue of the killing of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani, India has said Pakistan "extols" the "virtues" of terrorists and uses terrorism as a state policy towards the "misguided end" of coveting the territory of others.

India's Ambassador to the UN Syed Akbaruddin responded strongly to the remarks made by Pakistan's envoy Maleeha Lodhi on Kashmir and Wani's killing during a debate on human rights in the 193-member UN General Assembly here yesterday.

In her statement, Lodhi, apart from raising the Kashmir issue, also mentioned the "extra-judicial" killing of Wani, whom she described as a "Kashmiri leader", by Indian forces.

In his statement, which sources here termed as perhaps the hardest-hitting against Pakistan in recent times, Akbaruddin said Pakistan "extols" the virtues of terrorists and could not gain membership of the UN's human rights body because of its "track record".

Lashing out at Lodhi's raising of the Kashmir issue at the multi-lateral world body, Akbaruddin said it is regrettable that Pakistan attempted to "misuse" the UN platform.

"Regrettably, earlier today we have seen an attempt at misuse of this UN platform. The attempt came from Pakistan; a country that covets the territory of others; a country that uses terrorism as state policy towards that misguided end; a country that extols the virtues of terrorists and that provides sanctuary to UN-designated terrorists; and a country that masquerades its efforts as support for human rights and self determination," he said.

Akbaruddin asserted that Pakistan's "track record" failed to convince the international community that it should gain membership of the Human Rights Council in this very session of the UNGA.

"The international community has long seen through such designs. Cynical attempts, like the one this morning therefore, find no resonance in this forum or elsewhere in the United Nations," he said.

Akbaruddin asserted in his statement that as a "diverse, pluralistic and tolerant" society, India's commitment to the rule of law, democracy and human rights is enshrined in its founding principles.

"We remain strongly committed to the promotion and protection of all human rights for all through pursuit of dialogue and cooperation," he said.

At least 30 people have been killed and more than 250 injured in the clashes between protesters and security personnel after Wani's killing in an encounter last week.

The UN has expressed concern over the tensed situation in Kashmir, with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon calling on all parties to exercise "maximum restraint to avoid further violence and hopes that all concerns would be addressed through peaceful means."

Ban's spokesman had said the UN Chief was closely following the recent clashes in Kashmir and "regrets" the loss of dozens of lives and injuries to many others.

China warned its rivals Wednesday against turning the South China Sea into a "cradle of war" and threatened an air defence zone there, after its claims to the strategically vital waters were declared invalid.

The surprisingly strong and sweeping ruling by a UN-backed tribunal in The Hague provided powerful diplomatic ammunition to the Philippines, which filed the challenge, and other claimants in their decades-long disputes with China over the resource-rich waters.

China reacted furiously to Tuesday's decision, insisting on its historical rights over the sea while launching a volley of thinly veiled warnings to the United States and other critical nations.

"Do not turn the South China Sea into a cradle of war," vice foreign minister Liu Zhenmin told reporters in Beijing, as he described the ruling as waste paper.

"China's aim is to turn the South China Sea into a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation."

Liu said China also had "the right" to establish an air defence identification zone (ADIZ) over the sea, which would give the Chinese military authority over foreign aircraft.

A similar zone set up in 2013 in the East China Sea riled Japan, the United States and its allies.

"Whether we need to set up one in the South China Sea depends on the level of threat we receive," he said.

"We hope other countries will not take the chance to blackmail China."

The Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, was even more blunt over the ramifications of the verdict.

"It will certainly intensify conflicts and even confrontation," Cui said in Washington on Tuesday.

China justifies its sovereignty claims by saying it was the first to have discovered, named and exploited the sea, and outlines its claims for most of the waterway using a vague map made up of nine dashes that emerged in the 1940s.

Those claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.

Manila, under previous president Benigno Aquino, launched the legal case in 2013 after China took control of Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing ground within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone and far away from the nearest major Chinese landmass.

China has also in recent years built giant artificial islands capable of hosting military installations and airstrips in the Spratlys archipelago, one of the biggest groups of islands in the sea.

Aside from stating that China's historical rights were without "legal basis", the tribunal ruled that its artificial island building and the blocking of Filipino fishermen at Scarborough Shoal were unlawful.

However the Philippines, under new President Rodrigo Duterte, declined to celebrate the verdict, saying on Tuesday only that it welcomed the ruling while calling for sobriety and restraint.

Duterte has repeatedly said he wants to improve relations with China, which plummeted under Aquino because of the dispute, and that he would seek Chinese investment for major infrastructure projects such as a railway for the impoverished southern Philippines.

His Foreign Minister, Perfecto Yasay, told AFP in an interview last week that the Philippines would seek to use the verdict as the basis for direct talks with China aimed at achieving a long-awaited code of conduct among rival claimants for the sea.

However China faced immediate pressure from Western powers, which insist they have legitimate interests in the dispute because of the need to maintain "freedom of navigation" in waters that hosts more than $5 trillion in shipping trade annually.

The United States emphasised on Tuesday that China, as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, should accept the verdict.

"As provided in the convention, the tribunal's decision is final and legally binding on both China and the Philippines," State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in Washington.

Kirby called on all sides "to avoid provocative statements or actions".

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop warned China on Wednesday there would be "strong reputational costs" for ignoring the ruling, as she called for an end to Chinese island building.

"China seeks to be a regional and global leader and requires friendly relations with its neighbours. That's crucial to its rise," Bishop told national broadcaster ABC.

Military tensions in the sea had already spiked in the lead-up to the verdict.

China launched naval drills in the northern areas, while the US Pacific Command said it had deployed an aircraft carrier for flights to support "security" in the sea.

Taiwan, which was another loser in the verdict as its claims are very similar to those of China, sent a warship to the sea on Wednesday to protect its claims.

China used deadly force to seize control of the Paracel Islands from South Vietnam in 1974, and Johnson Reef from a united Vietnam in 1988.

German defense contractor ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) signed a $ 38.4 million contract for the modernization of two out of four Shishumar-class (Type 209/1500) diesel-electric attack submarines in service with the Indian Navy on June 29, according to Indian media reports.

The four 1,450-ton Shishumar-class SSKs form the Indian Navy’s 10th submarine squadron based in Mumbai. Two Shishumar-class submarines were assembled at the Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) at Kiel in Germany, while the third and fourth vessels of the class were license-built at Mumbai’s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and commissioned in the early 1990s.

The upgrade of the two license-built SSKs, aimed at extending their operational life by ten years, will also take place in Mumbai, according to a TKMS press release. TKMS’s contract with the Indian Navy entails fitting the boats with a new weapons suite–Boeing anti-ship UGM-84L Harpoon Block encapsulated missile systems.

In detail, the new weapons package includes 12 UGM-84L Harpoon Block II Encapsulated Missiles, 10 UTM-84L Harpoon Encapsulated Training missiles, and two Encapsulated Harpoon certification training vehicles. TKMS will also offer training to support and operate the new weapon system.

The upgrades will likely only take place on the latest two license-built Shishummar-class vessels due to technical limitations. “Only these two (Shalki and Shankul) can be done because certain modifications to the firing chain for missile launch need to be incorporated, which in a ‘fitted for’ configurations had already been catered for. Only the impulse flasks etc need to be added in the firing chain as the torpedoes are in swim out mode,” an Indian Navy official told local media.

“It is a key milestone in our long-standing commitment towards India. We have the capacity to integrate any weapon system that is selected by the Indian Navy, onto our submarines. We are happy to take on this project to now integrate the harpoon missiles in two of the four SSK submarines ” Gurnad Sodhi, Managing Director of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems India, said.
